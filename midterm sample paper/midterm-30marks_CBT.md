# Coding Questions
---
**Question 1: (5 Marks)**

Write a Python program that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that are divisible by both 2 and 3. Use a `for` loop for this task.

**Example:**
```python

Sample Input 1
10
Sample Output 1
6

Sample Input 2
15
Sample Output 2
18
```

---

**Question 2: (7 Marks)**

You are given a string `sentence` containing words separated by spaces. Write a Python program that counts the number of vowels in the sentence and prints the result.

**Example:**
```python
Sample Input 1
`Hello, how are you?`
Sample Output 1
7

Sample Input 2
`Python is amazing!`
Sample Output 2
5
```

---

**Question 3: (8 Marks)**

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program that squares each element of the list and then filters out the even squared numbers. Finally, print the resulting squared and filtered list in a single line.

**Example:**
```python
Sample Input 1
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1
1 9 25

sample Input 2
2 4 6 8 10
Sample Output 2
None
```
